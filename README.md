*More files can be created depending on the stores/centers you want
create/open.

The “CENTRAL” file is the “management body” where all the centers are controlled. Us we decided to call the stores “centers”, but “store” and “center” will be synonymous. All others files are unique centers, each with its own code to differentiate them.

We decided to create a database that would be applied to a company that sells electronic equipment and that company is called “Eletroártica”. Our company has a concept similar to Worten.
